# Student Database Management System

## Overview
The Student Database Management System is a command-line application developed as a group project for the C Programming course. This project demonstrates the use of linked lists to dynamically manage student records, including functionalities for user login, viewing, editing, and inserting student details.

## Features
- User Registration and Login
- Display Specific Student Details
- Insert New Student Records
- Edit Existing Student Records

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Data Structures:** Linked Lists

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanjeevikumar-kv/studentdatabasemanagementsystem.git
    ```

2. **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    gcc -o studentdbms studentdbms.c
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./studentdbms
    ```

## Project Structure
- `studentdbms.c` - Main source file containing all functionalities.

## Functionality
- **Login:**
    - Prompts the user to enter a username and password.
    - Validates the user credentials to allow access to further functionalities.
  
- **Display Specific Student Details:**
    - Prompts the user to enter the student's name and roll number.
    - Displays the student's details if found, otherwise displays an error message.
  
- **Insert New Student Records:**
    - Prompts the user to enter new student details including name, age, college year, GPA, CGPA, and roll number.
    - Adds the new student record to the database.

- **Edit Existing Student Records:**
    - Prompts the user to enter the roll number of the student whose details need to be edited.
    - Allows the user to update the student's details.

## Usage
1. **Login:**
   ```text
   Enter your username: [username]
   Enter your password: [password]
   Valid credentials for testing:
   Username: Kumar, Password: 123
   Username: Raja, Password: 101
   Username: Raju, Password: 102
   
2.**Display Specific Student Details:**

    
      
    Enter Student Name: [name]
    Enter Student Roll No: [roll number]
    Insert New Student Records:
    


    
    Enter Name of Student: [name]
    Enter Age: [age]
    Enter College Year: [college year]
    Enter GPA: [gpa]
    Enter CGPA: [cgpa]
    Enter Roll No: [roll number]
    Edit Existing Student Records:
    
    

    Enter Student Roll No: [roll number]
    Enter Name: [new name]
    Enter Age: [new age]
    Enter College Year: [new college year]
    Enter GPA: [new gpa]
    Enter CGPA: [new cgpa]
